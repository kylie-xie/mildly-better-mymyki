# Mildly Better MyMyki (WIP)

Hacked together a user stylesheet to make the website mildly more useable (?).

Warning: extremely ugly CSS. Also still has plenty of quirks to work out, haven't really tested it.

Feel free to use/fix/improve, I hope it also makes your experience mildly better.

Use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) to apply the stylesheet.
